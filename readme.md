# minimaldroid4

This is minimal example building android project without
gradle. It uses xmake under the hood. Also you should
have sdkmanager command installed (pip install sdkmanager)
or read the documentation in build.nims nim script. 

## Screenshot of app I built
![screenshot](./screenshot/screenshot.jpg)
It has SDL2 java and c++ and xmake integration.
(the same you'll get by building this project)

## Requirements to build for Android
1. git
1. sdkmanager (pip install sdkmanager)
1. xmake
